       "[\"Euclidean geometry is a mathematical system attributed to Alexandrian Greek mathematician Euclid, which he described in his textbook on geometry: the Elements.Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms, and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these.Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians, Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and logical system.The Elements begins with plane geometry, still taught in secondary school (high school) as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of mathematical proofs.It goes on to the solid geometry of three dimensions.\",\n",
       " 'Much of the Elements states results of what are now called algebra and number theory, explained in geometrical language.For more than two thousand years, the adjective \"Euclidean\" was unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived.Euclid\\'s axioms seemed so intuitively obvious (with the possible exception of the parallel postulate) that any theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute, often metaphysical, sense.Today, however, many other self-consistent non-Euclidean geometries are known, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century.An implication of Albert Einstein\\'s theory of general relativity is that physical space itself is not Euclidean, and Euclidean space is a good approximation for it only over short distances (relative to the strength of the  gravitational field).Euclidean geometry is an example of synthetic geometry, in that it proceeds logically from axioms describing basic properties of geometric objects such as points and lines, to propositions about those objects, all without the use of coordinates to specify those objects.This is in contrast to analytic geometry, which uses coordinates to translate geometric propositions into algebraic formulas.\\n\\n\\n The Elements \\n\\nThe Elements is mainly a systematization of earlier knowledge of geometry.',\n",
       " 'Its improvement over earlier treatments was rapidly recognized, with the result that there was little interest in preserving the earlier ones, and they are now nearly all lost.\\nThere are 13 books in the Elements:\\nBooks I–IV and VI discuss plane geometry.Many results about plane figures are proved, for example, \"In any triangle two angles taken together in any manner are less than two right angles.\" (Book I proposition 17) and the Pythagorean theorem \"In right angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle.\" (Book I, proposition 47)\\nBooks V and VII–X deal with number theory, with numbers treated geometrically as lengths of line segments or areas of regions.Notions such as prime numbers and rational and irrational numbers are introduced.It is proved that there are infinitely many prime numbers.\\nBooks XI–XIII concern solid geometry.A typical result is the 1:3 ratio between the volume of a cone and a cylinder with the same height and base.',\n",
       " 'It is now known that such a proof is impossible, since one can construct consistent systems of geometry (obeying the other axioms) in which the parallel postulate is true, and others in which it is false.Euclid himself seems to have considered it as being qualitatively different from the others, as evidenced by the organization of the Elements: his first 28 propositions are those that can be proved without it.\\nMany alternative axioms can be formulated which are logically equivalent to the parallel postulate (in the context of the other axioms).For example, Playfair\\'s axiom states:\\n\\nIn a plane, through a point not on a given straight line, at most one line can be drawn that never meets the given line.The \"at most\" clause is all that is needed since it can be proved from the remaining axioms that at least one parallel line exists.\\n\\n\\n Methods of proof \\nEuclidean Geometry is constructive.Postulates 1, 2, 3, and 5 assert the existence and uniqueness of certain geometric figures, and these assertions are of a constructive nature: that is, we are not only told that certain things exist, but are also given methods for creating them with no more than a compass and an unmarked straightedge.In this sense, Euclidean geometry is more concrete than many modern axiomatic systems such as set theory, which often assert the existence of objects without saying how to construct them, or even assert the existence of objects that cannot be constructed within the theory.',\n",
       " 'Strictly speaking, the lines on paper are models of the objects defined within the formal system, rather than instances of those objects.For example, a Euclidean straight line has no width, but any real drawn line will.Though nearly all modern mathematicians consider nonconstructive methods just as sound as constructive ones, Euclid\\'s constructive proofs often supplanted fallacious nonconstructive ones—e.g., some of the Pythagoreans\\' proofs that involved irrational numbers, which usually required a statement such as \"Find the greatest common measure of ...\"Euclid often used proof by contradiction.Euclidean geometry also allows the method of superposition, in which a figure is transferred to another point in space.For example, proposition I.4, side-angle-side congruence of triangles, is proved by moving one of the two triangles so that one of its sides coincides with the other triangle\\'s equal side, and then proving that the other sides coincide as well.',\n",
       " 'Some modern treatments add a sixth postulate, the rigidity of the triangle, which can be used as an alternative to superposition.\\n\\n\\n System of measurement and arithmetic \\nEuclidean geometry has two fundamental types of measurements: angle and distance.The angle scale is absolute, and Euclid uses the right angle as his basic unit, so that, for example, a 45-degree angle would be referred to as half of a right angle.The distance scale is relative; one arbitrarily picks a line segment with a certain nonzero length as the unit, and other distances are expressed in relation to it.Addition of distances is represented by a construction in which one line segment is copied onto the end of another line segment to extend its length, and similarly for subtraction.\\nMeasurements of area and volume are derived from distances.For example, a rectangle with a width of 3 and a length of 4 has an area that represents the product, 12.',\n",
       " 'Because this geometrical interpretation of multiplication was limited to three dimensions, there was no direct way of interpreting the product of four or more numbers, and Euclid avoided such products, although they are implied, for example in the proof of book IX, proposition 20.\\n\\nEuclid refers to a pair of lines, or a pair of planar or solid figures, as \"equal\" (ἴσος) if their lengths, areas, or volumes are equal respectively, and similarly for angles.The stronger term \"congruent\" refers to the idea that an entire figure is the same size and shape as another figure.Alternatively, two figures are congruent if one can be moved on top of the other so that it matches up with it exactly.(Flipping it over is allowed.) Thus, for example, a 2x6 rectangle and a 3x4 rectangle are equal but not congruent, and the letter R is congruent to its mirror image.Figures that would be congruent except for their differing sizes are referred to as similar.',\n",
       " \"The fundamental types of measurements in Euclidean geometry are distances and angles, both of which can be measured directly by a surveyor.Historically, distances were often measured by chains, such as Gunter's chain, and angles using graduated circles and, later, the theodolite.\\nAn application of Euclidean solid geometry is the determination of packing arrangements, such as the problem of finding the most efficient packing of spheres in n dimensions.This problem has applications in error detection and correction.\\nGeometric optics uses Euclidean geometry to analyze the focusing of light by lenses and mirrors.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nGeometry is used extensively in architecture.\\nGeometry can be used to design origami.Some classical construction problems of geometry are impossible using compass and straightedge, but can be solved using origami.Quite a lot of CAD (computer-aided design) and CAM (computer-aided manufacturing) is based on Euclidean geometry.Design geometry typically consists of shapes bounded by planes, cylinders, cones, tori, etc.\",\n",
       " \"In the present day, CAD/CAM is essential in the design of almost everything, including cars, airplanes, ships, and smartphones.A few decades ago, sophisticated draftsmen learned some fairly advanced Euclidean geometry, including things like Pascal's theorem and Brianchon's theorem.But now they don't have to, because the geometric constructions are all done by CAD programs.\\n\\n\\n As a description of the structure of space \\nEuclid believed that his axioms were self-evident statements about physical reality.Euclid's proofs depend upon assumptions perhaps not obvious in Euclid's fundamental axioms, in particular that certain movements of figures do not change their geometrical properties such as the lengths of sides and interior angles, the so-called Euclidean motions, which include translations, reflections and rotations of figures.Taken as a physical description of space, postulate 2 (extending a line) asserts that space does not have holes or boundaries; postulate 4 (equality of right angles) says that space is isotropic and figures may be moved to any location while maintaining congruence; and postulate 5 (the parallel postulate) that space is flat (has no intrinsic curvature).As discussed in more detail below, Albert Einstein's theory of relativity significantly modifies this view.\\nThe ambiguous character of the axioms as originally formulated by Euclid makes it possible for different commentators to disagree about some of their other implications for the structure of space, such as whether or not it is infinite (see below) and what its topology is.\",\n",
       " \"Modern, more rigorous reformulations of the system typically aim for a cleaner separation of these issues.Interpreting Euclid's axioms in the spirit of this more modern approach, axioms 1-4 are consistent with either infinite or finite space (as in elliptic geometry), and all five axioms are consistent with a variety of topologies (e.g., a plane, a cylinder, or a torus for two-dimensional Euclidean geometry).\\n\\n\\n Later work \\n\\n\\n= Archimedes and Apollonius =\\n\\nArchimedes (c.287 BCE – c.212 BCE), a colorful figure about whom many historical anecdotes are recorded, is remembered along with Euclid as one of the greatest of ancient mathematicians.Although the foundations of his work were put in place by Euclid, his work, unlike Euclid's, is believed to have been entirely original.\",\n",
       " 'Many tried in vain to prove the fifth postulate from the first four.By 1763, at least 28 different proofs had been published, but all were found incorrect.Leading up to this period, geometers also tried to determine what constructions could be accomplished in Euclidean geometry.For example, the problem of trisecting an angle with a compass and straightedge is one that naturally occurs within the theory, since the axioms refer to constructive operations that can be carried out with those tools.However, centuries of efforts failed to find a solution to this problem, until Pierre Wantzel published a proof in 1837 that such a construction was impossible.Other constructions that were proved impossible include doubling the cube and squaring the circle.',\n",
       " \"In the case of doubling the cube, the impossibility of the construction originates from the fact that the compass and straightedge method involve equations whose order is an integral power of two, while doubling a cube requires the solution of a third-order equation.\\nEuler discussed a generalization of Euclidean geometry called affine geometry, which retains the fifth postulate unmodified while weakening postulates three and four in a way that eliminates the notions of angle (whence right triangles become meaningless) and of equality of length of line segments in general (whence circles become meaningless) while retaining the notions of parallelism as an equivalence relation between lines, and equality of length of parallel line segments (so line segments continue to have a midpoint).\\n\\n\\n= 19th century and non-Euclidean geometry =\\n\\nIn the early 19th century, Carnot and Möbius systematically developed the use of signed angles and line segments as a way of simplifying and unifying results.The century's most significant development in geometry occurred when, around 1830, János Bolyai and Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky separately published work on non-Euclidean geometry, in which the parallel postulate is not valid.Since non-Euclidean geometry is provably relatively consistent with Euclidean geometry, the parallel postulate cannot be proved from the other postulates.\\nIn the 19th century, it was also realized that Euclid's ten axioms and common notions do not suffice to prove all of the theorems stated in the Elements.For example, Euclid assumed implicitly that any line contains at least two points, but this assumption cannot be proved from the other axioms, and therefore must be an axiom itself.The very first geometric proof in the Elements, shown in the figure above, is that any line segment is part of a triangle; Euclid constructs this in the usual way, by drawing circles around both endpoints and taking their intersection as the third vertex.His axioms, however, do not guarantee that the circles actually intersect, because they do not assert the geometrical property of continuity, which in Cartesian terms is equivalent to the completeness property of the real numbers.\",\n",
       " 'Starting with Moritz Pasch in 1882, many improved axiomatic systems for geometry have been proposed, the best known being those of Hilbert, George Birkhoff, and Tarski.\\n\\n\\n= 20th century and relativity =\\n\\nEinstein\\'s theory of special relativity involves a four-dimensional space-time, the Minkowski space, which is non-Euclidean.This shows that non-Euclidean geometries, which had been introduced a few years earlier for showing that the parallel postulate cannot be proved, are also useful for describing the physical world.\\nHowever, the three-dimensional \"space part\" of the Minkowski space remains the space of Euclidean geometry.This is not the case with general relativity, for which the geometry of the space part of space-time is not Euclidean geometry.For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do not add up to 180 degrees due to gravity.A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth\\'s or the sun\\'s, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean.',\n",
       " 'Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist.They were later verified by observations such as the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and such considerations are now an integral part of the software that runs the GPS system.\\n\\n\\n Treatment of infinity \\n\\n\\n= Infinite objects =\\nEuclid sometimes distinguished explicitly between \"finite lines\" (e.g., Postulate 2) and \"infinite lines\" (book I, proposition 12).However, he typically did not make such distinctions unless they were necessary.The postulates do not explicitly refer to infinite lines, although for example some commentators interpret postulate 3, existence of a circle with any radius, as implying that space is infinite.The notion of infinitesimal quantities had previously been discussed extensively by the Eleatic School, but nobody had been able to put them on a firm logical basis, with paradoxes such as Zeno\\'s paradox occurring that had not been resolved to universal satisfaction.Euclid used the method of exhaustion rather than infinitesimals.Later ancient commentators, such as Proclus (410–485 CE), treated many questions about infinity as issues demanding proof and, e.g., Proclus claimed to prove the infinite divisibility of a line, based on a proof by contradiction in which he considered the cases of even and odd numbers of points constituting it.At the turn of the 20th century, Otto Stolz, Paul du Bois-Reymond, Giuseppe Veronese, and others produced controversial work on non-Archimedean models of Euclidean geometry, in which the distance between two points may be infinite or infinitesimal, in the Newton–Leibniz sense.',\n",
       " \"Thus, mathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true.\\nSuch foundational approaches range between foundationalism and formalism.\\n\\n\\n= Axiomatic formulations =\\nGeometry is the science of correct reasoning on incorrect figures.\\nEuclid's axioms: In his dissertation to Trinity College, Cambridge, Bertrand Russell summarized the changing role of Euclid's geometry in the minds of philosophers up to that time.It was a conflict between certain knowledge, independent of experiment, and empiricism, requiring experimental input.This issue became clear as it was discovered that the parallel postulate was not necessarily valid and its applicability was an empirical matter, deciding whether the applicable geometry was Euclidean or non-Euclidean.\\nHilbert's axioms: Hilbert's axioms had the goal of identifying a simple and complete set of independent axioms from which the most important geometric theorems could be deduced.The outstanding objectives were to make Euclidean geometry rigorous (avoiding hidden assumptions) and to make clear the ramifications of the parallel postulate.\\nBirkhoff's axioms: Birkhoff proposed four postulates for Euclidean geometry that can be confirmed experimentally with scale and protractor.This system relies heavily on the properties of the real numbers.\"]"
